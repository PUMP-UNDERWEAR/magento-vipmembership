Meanbee VIP Membership
=====================

Meanbee VIP Membership adds an Amazon Prime style membership system to your Magento store. By creating the membership product and adding it to your store your customers can then become a VIP member by purchasing the product.

This works by assigning the logged-in user to a new customer group once the product has been purchased. With the customer group you can add give your customers special prices on products, special discount codes, and offer discounts on shipping. Much in the same as other VIP-style memberships work, such as ASOS Premier and Amazon Prime.

VIP Membership products are configured with an expiry date, where you define how long it lasts for. For example, you can configure it to last for 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year. The expiry date is added to the customer once purchased.

If you are looking to offer more to your regular customers, such as discounts and free shipping, VIP Membership is an excellent way to go.
